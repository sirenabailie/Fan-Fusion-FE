# Fan Fiction App
## About this app
This app is a platform for fan fiction enthusiasts to create, share, and explore stories. Users can sign in, create and edit their own stories, and browse through stories from other writers. With category and tag filters, a personalized profile page, and a dark mode option, this app enhances the reading and writing experience for fan fiction fans.

## Features
1. User Authentication
Users can sign in to create and manage their stories. Only authenticated users have access to story creation, editing, and deletion.
2. CRUD Operations on Stories
Users can create, read, update, and delete their own stories. This ensures that each writer has full control over their content while also maintaining privacy for other users' stories.
3. CRUD Operations on Chapters
Stories can be organized into chapters, and each chapter can be created, edited, or deleted by the story's author.
4. Categories and Tags Pages
   - Categories: Stories can be browsed by category, allowing users to filter content based on their interests.
   - Tags: Users can also filter stories by tags, offering a more specific search based on themes or tropes.
5. Profile Page
The profile page displays:
- User-Created Stories: A list of stories the user has authored.
- Favorited Stories: Stories that the user has marked as favorites.
- Chapter Drafts: Drafts of chapters the user is currently working on.
Users can only perform CRUD operations on their own stories and chapters from their profile page.
6. Dark Mode Toggle
The app includes a dark mode toggle in the navbar, implemented with react-bootstrap. The dark mode setting is persistent, maintaining the user's preference across reloads and route changes.

## Usage

2. Browse Stories: Explore stories on the home page, by category, or by tag filters.
